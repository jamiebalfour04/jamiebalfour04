## 🙈 Me briefly

- 👋 Hi, I’m @jamiebalfour04
- 👀 I’m interested in computer hardware, programming, computer language design, user experience and web design/development. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Go programming language
- 🤓 I've built and written my programming language, YASS, which includes a parser, compiler, runtime, and transpilers, collectively known as the ZPE Programming Environment.
- 💞️ I'm primarily working on my projects, such as ZPE/YASS and DASH, as well as my own WISP project.
- 😍 Most of my work involves web design and development, computer language parsing and compiler design.
- ⭐️ I'm a natural leader and have been running my digital agency since July 2018
- 🎤 I love speaking at events and had the pleasure of giving a talk at an Amazon conference in 2018
- 💼 I'm the Executive Director of Jambour Digital. 
- 🎓 I teach secondary-level Computing Science in Scotland and have mentored other software developers. I like my job, but my skillset is more in code!
- 🛠 I mostly use PHP, Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, HTML + CSS, Lua Script (for modding games) and everyone's favourite, SQL.
- 📫 You can find me at [jamiebalfour.scot](https://www.jamiebalfour.scot)!
- 🏫 I studied Computer Science at Heriot-Watt University, where I earned a 1st Class BSc (I aced university getting all but 5 As in all modules), and then obtained my Postgraduate Diploma in Education from the University of Strathclyde.

Professional skills include (but are not limited to):
- ✨ Leadership

- 📚 Education

This is my updated GitHub account, created by clearing the previous content from my old one. I publish many of my main projects here, including BalfBar, BalfSlider, BalfRibbon, and others. I also have many private repositories, such as ZPE, that I work on myself.

## 🚀 My Technical Skills
My primary skills are related to computer language design, compilers, and runtime environments. I also love web design and development, encompassing both front-end and back-end aspects. I love writing software and have a passion for making things perfect 👌!

I'm exceptionally skilled in software development.
