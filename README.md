## 🙈 Me briefly

- 👋 Hi, I’m @jamiebalfour04
- 👀 I’m interested in computer hardware, programming, computer language design, user experience and web design/development. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Go programming language
- 🤓 I've written my own programming language, YASS, including a parser, compiler, runtime and transpilers, collectively known as the ZPE Programming Environment.
- 💞️ I'm primarily working on my own projects, such as ZPE/YASS and DASH, as well as my own WISP project.
- 😍 Most of my work involves web design and development, computer language parsing and compiler design.
- ⭐️ I'm a natural leader and have been running my digital agency since July 2018
- 🎤 I love speaking at events and had the pleasure of giving a talk at an Amazon conference in 2018
- 💼 I'm the Executive Director of Jambour Digital. 
- 🎓 I teach secondary-level Computing Science in Scotland and have mentored other software developers. I like my job, but my skillset is more in code!
- 🛠 I mostly use PHP, Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, HTML + CSS and everyone's favourite, SQL.
- 📫 You can find me at [jamiebalfour.scot](https://www.jamiebalfour.scot)!
- 🏫 I studied Computer Science at Heriot-Watt University (I got a 1st Class BSc) and then got my Postgraduate Diploma in Education from the University of Strathclyde.

Professional skills include (but are not limited to):
- ✨ Leadership
- 🤖 Automation
- 💻 Computer Language Design
- 🎨 User Experience & Interface Design

This is my updated GitHub account after clearing the previous content from it. I publish many of my main projects here, such as BalfBar, BalfSlider, BalfRibbon, and so on. I also have many private repos that I am working on myself.

## 🚀 My Technical Skills
My primary skills are related to computer language design and compiler and runtime environments. I also love web design and development, both front-end and back-end. I love writing software and have a passion for making things perfect 👌!

I'm exceptionally talented when it comes to software development.
